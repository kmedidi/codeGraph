# codeGraph
Graphical analysis of code

## Idea
Parse code and identify nodes (methods), associate meta-data to them (which object they belong to, namespace) and then create an adjacency matrix, to describe a graphical relationship between the nodes. The graphical nature of the result can help in further analysis such as finding dependecies.

## Implementation scope
Code base consisting of pure Javascript using esprima parser.

## Conclusion
Graphical representation allows for easier analysis with intuitive techniques.
